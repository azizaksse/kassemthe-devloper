Magic Portfolio ships with sensible defaults for metadata, schema, and social images. Update the values in `src/resources/content.tsx` and `src/resources/once-ui.config.ts` to personalize titles, descriptions, and `baseURL`.

## Social sharing image

Use a static asset from `public`, for example set `home.image` to `/images/og/home.jpg`. Reference that same path in your page metadata so every route has a shareable image.

## Quick checklist

- Set `baseURL` to your domain.
- Confirm each page has a clear `title` and `description`.
- Point `home.image` (and any other pages) to a real file in `public/images/og`.
