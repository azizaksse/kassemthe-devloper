Magic Portfolio ships with a handful of Once UI components pre-wired for MDX, so you can write posts that stay visually consistent with the rest of the site.

## What is available

- Typography (headings, paragraphs, inline code)
- Layout primitives (rows, columns, grids)
- Common UI elements (buttons, cards, tables, icons, media)

## How to use them

Write MDX with the component tags you need, for example:

```
<Row>
  <Button variant="secondary" label="Action" />
  <InlineCode>const ready = true;</InlineCode>
</Row>
```

## Adding your own components

If you want more components, add them to `src/components/mdx.tsx` so MDX knows how to render them. Keep the surface area small to avoid pulling in client-only code when you don't need it.
